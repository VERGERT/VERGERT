<div id="overflowTest">The 22-year-old went down holding his calf and was replaced by James Milner in the second half of the Premier League match
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says Trent Alexander-Arnold will withdraw from the England squad after suffering a calf injury during Sunday's 1-1 draw at Manchester City.
The 22-year-old went down holding his calf shortly after the hour mark of the game at Etihad Stadium and was subsequently replaced by James Milner, who made his 750th competitive appearance and his 550th in the Premier League.
The showdown between the last two Premier League title winners would end 1-1, as Mohamed Salah's early spot-kick was cancelled out by a great strike from Gabriel Jesus.

Speaking after the game Reds boss Klopp said Alexander-Arnold will have a scan on Monday to determine the severity of the injury, though revealed it is serious enough for him to pull out of England duty.
“Trent will be out for England, that’s is clear," said the German.
“What he has, we don’t know, but he cannot play for England. He will not be the last and not the only one who Gareth [Southgate] will miss for this international break.
“He will have a scan tomorrow and then we will see.”

The domestic dog's origin includes the dog's genetic divergence from the wolf, its domestication, and its development into dog types and dog breeds. The dog is a member of the genus Canis, which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and was the first species and the only large carnivore to have been domesticated.[14][27] Genetic studies comparing dogs with modern wolves show reciprocal monophyly (separate groups), which implies that dogs are not genetically close to any living wolf and that their wild ancestor is extinct.[28][14] An extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been the dog's ancestor,[27][1] with the dog's similarity to the extant grey wolf being the result of genetic admixture between the two.[1] In 2020, a literature review of canid domestication stated that modern dogs were not descended from the same Canis lineage as modern wolves, and proposes that dogs may be descended from a Pleistocene wolf closer in size to a village dog.[29]

The genetic divergence between dogs and wolves occurred between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago, just before or during the Last Glacial Maximum[30][1] (20,000–27,000 years ago). This period represents the upper time-limit for domestication commencement because it is the time of divergence and not the time of domestication, which occurred later.[30][31] One of the most critical transitions in human history was the domestication of animals, which began with the long-term association between wolves and hunter–gatherers more than 15,000 years ago.[28] The archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the Bonn–Oberkassel dog buried beside humans 14,200 years ago to be the first undisputed dog, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago.[1] By 11,000 years ago, there were five distinct dog lineages which all had shared a common ancestry distinct from present-day wolves.[32]

Klopp had been left with inexperienced defenders Rhys Williams and Nathaniel Phillips to fill the gaps until he welcomed Joel Matip back into the heart of the defence for Sunday's game against Pep Guardiola's team, partnering Joe Gomez.
Liverpool headed into the game looking to return to the top of the table with a win but must be content with a third-place spot, one point behind leaders Leicester. Meanwhile, last year's runners-up City are in 11th place.

The hosts have had an inconsistent start to the campaign, having collected 12 points from their first seven matches, leaving them six points adrift of Leicester, who climbed to the top with a 1-0 win against Wolves earlier on Sunday.
News of Alexander-Arnold's injury will be a blow to England manager Gareth Southgate, who named the Liverpool academy graduate in his squad for the friendly with Republic of Ireland next Thursday and UEFA Nations League matches against Belgium and Iceland.
However, the clash at home to Iceland is now in doubt after the UK government issued a travel ban on visitors coming from Denmark following an outbreak of Covid-19 at mink farms which have spread to local communities in the Scandinavian country.
